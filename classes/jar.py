# Note that it‚Äôs not as easy to test instance methods as it is to test functions
# alone, since instance methods sometimes manipulate the same ‚Äústate‚Äù (i.e., instance variables).
# To test one method (e.g., withdraw), then, you might need to call another method first (e.g., deposit).
# But the method you call first might itself not be correct!

# And so programmers sometimes mock (i.e., simulate) state when testing methods, as
# with Python‚Äôs own mock object library, so that you can call just the one method
# but modify the underlying state first, without calling the other method to do so.

# For simplicity, though, no need to mock any state. Implement your tests as you normally would!
